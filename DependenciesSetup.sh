#This project is running on Ubuntu Mate for Raspberry pi, but will be written in 
#python and php, so it should be easy to setup on different environments, and even different units, 
#like intel based computers, and running parts on arduino, etc.
#A must-have is of course a GPIO, so if you want to setup your computer with this, 
#please buy https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264 or similar.
#The following setup is a work in progress, and SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SAFE NOR GOOD PRACTICE. (Especially the symlink parts) 
#Your computer/Raspberry Pi will most likely be very easy to hack.

#Set standard directory, and create directories
cd ~/
mkdir workspace
cd workspace
mkdir chempi
cd chempi

#Standard install without Big Algae
sudo apt-get install apache2 php mariadb-server git python-pip libapache2-mod-php
sudo pip install picamera configparser
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TobiasFP/ChemPi.git

#Create symlink to html folder
sudo rm -R /var/www/html
sudo ln -s ~/workspace/chempi/ChemPi/html /var/www/html

#setup permissions, but please keep in mind that this is not written to be secure just yet.
sudo chmod u=rwX,g=srX,o=rX -R /var/www/
sudo chmod u=rwX,g=srX,o=rX -R ~/workspace/chempi/ChemPi/html/

#Allow GPIO and camera to operate:
sudo echo "dtoverlay=w1-gpio" >> /boot/config.txt
sudo echo "start_x=1" >> /boot/config.txt


#Big Algae dependencies and installation
echo "Do you want Big Algae?, (y/n) + [ENTER]:" 
echo "Note: Big Algae will only work if you have at least 2GB of SWAP space. You probably donÂ´t."
echo "...and the bigalgae website functions fine without this module. This is for own Big Algae install."
